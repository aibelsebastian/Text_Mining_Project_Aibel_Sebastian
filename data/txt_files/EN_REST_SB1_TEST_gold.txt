This establishment really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of FOOD TELEVISIONS "DINERS, DRIVE-INS, AND DIVES" hosted by Guy Fieri, in which Schooner or Later was subject of.	RESTAURANT#GENERAL

Chintzy portions	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS
– The sushi here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).	FOOD#QUALITY*RESTAURANT#PRICES*FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS*FOOD#PRICES
We easily spent more than $40 per person (not including alcohol) and were still hungry.	RESTAURANT#PRICES*FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS

We put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it'd be a 30 minute wait.	SERVICE#GENERAL
We went back to the restaurant and low and behold, we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago!!	SERVICE#GENERAL
None that I can think of.	SERVICE#GENERAL
We put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers, the food didn't arrive until 45 minutes later...WITH OUR MAIN COURSE.	SERVICE#GENERAL
Um so now what are appetizers for???	SERVICE#GENERAL
Oh I forgot to mention that they don't have bread service.	SERVICE#GENERAL
My wife also ordered a teapot of hot water (she had a sore throat) and I guess that since it was only water, it wasn't a priority for them to actually bring it.	SERVICE#GENERAL
In other words, if they aren't making $$ off of you then you don't rate high on their 'service scale'.	SERVICE#GENERAL
Food wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy place.	FOOD#QUALITY*RESTAURANT#PRICES*AMBIENCE#GENERAL
If I needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or Golden Gate park.	LOCATION#GENERAL

Very poor customer service.	SERVICE#GENERAL
– Schooner or Later's charming location along the marina in Long Beach and average food does not, unfortunately, compensate for its very poor customer service.	LOCATION#GENERAL*FOOD#QUALITY*SERVICE#GENERAL
While this diner had reasonably good food, the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.	FOOD#QUALITY*SERVICE#GENERAL
As part of a small party of four, our food was dropped off without comment;	SERVICE#GENERAL
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table.	SERVICE#GENERAL
When we finally were able to flag someone down, it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food, who was also not the same person who had taken our order.	SERVICE#GENERAL
After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress, a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant.	SERVICE#GENERAL
A brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment--to say we had been "blown off" would be an understatement.	SERVICE#GENERAL
The manager continually interrupted with "Is there anything else I can do for you?", a strange comment because she had hardly listened, let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience.	SERVICE#GENERAL
She promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage, but we could hardly take her promise seriously, seeing as she hadn't bothered to get the waitresses name.	SERVICE#GENERAL
In short, Schooner or Later couldn't have cared less about our being at their establishment.	SERVICE#GENERAL

It?s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction, though both were indistinguishable in taste.	FOOD#QUALITY*FOOD#QUALITY
Though, one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the steak.	FOOD#QUALITY

They came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting; very light and not-too-sweet.	FOOD#QUALITY
