Great Indian food	FOOD#QUALITY
Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had.	FOOD#QUALITY
Very "normal Indian food", but done really well.	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS*FOOD#QUALITY
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel.	RESTAURANT#GENERAL*RESTAURANT#PRICES*FOOD#PRICES*AMBIENCE#GENERAL
Also, waiters try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $.	SERVICE#GENERAL
I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).	SERVICE#GENERAL*RESTAURANT#PRICES
But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for Indian food	FOOD#QUALITY*RESTAURANT#PRICES

Wretched and retching	RESTAURANT#GENERAL
I have never been so disgusted by both food an service.	FOOD#QUALITY*SERVICE#GENERAL
For starters they delivered us someone else's order.	SERVICE#GENERAL
However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.	FOOD#QUALITY*FOOD#QUALITY
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.	FOOD#QUALITY*SERVICE#GENERAL
None was made so i hung up.	SERVICE#GENERAL
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet.	FOOD#QUALITY
My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.

It wasn't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand, but now it's simply repulsive.	RESTAURANT#GENERAL

Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City	AMBIENCE#GENERAL
This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (that don’t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!	RESTAURANT#GENERAL*AMBIENCE#GENERAL
Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot, once you enter the unmarked wooden doors, the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you’re no longer in the city.	LOCATION#GENERAL*AMBIENCE#GENERAL*AMBIENCE#GENERAL
If you’re planning to come here, make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky!).

We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating.	SERVICE#GENERAL

Dumbfoundingly Poor	RESTAURANT#GENERAL
This was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience.	RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn.	SERVICE#GENERAL
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.	SERVICE#GENERAL
Polite acknowledgement is out;	SERVICE#GENERAL
supercilious scorn is in.	SERVICE#GENERAL
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?	SERVICE#GENERAL
A different server enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).	SERVICE#GENERAL*FOOD#QUALITY
Overall the food quality was pretty good, though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest.	FOOD#QUALITY*SERVICE#GENERAL
The place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)	AMBIENCE#GENERAL*AMBIENCE#GENERAL*DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS*SERVICE#GENERAL
At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture.	RESTAURANT#PRICES*RESTAURANT#GENERAL*SERVICE#GENERAL

I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled.	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS
It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes.	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS*FOOD#QUALITY
I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.	FOOD#QUALITY*FOOD#PRICES
At this point, the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress WALKED away.	SERVICE#GENERAL
So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.	FOOD#QUALITY
I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.	FOOD#QUALITY
Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, "oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier" No apology, nothing.	SERVICE#GENERAL
After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!	SERVICE#GENERAL
No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!	SERVICE#GENERAL
This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.	SERVICE#GENERAL
Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!	SERVICE#GENERAL
The level of rudeness was preposterous.	SERVICE#GENERAL

Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don't put you off – 	FOOD#QUALITY*SERVICE#GENERAL
It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years. 	RESTAURANT#PRICES

As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS*SERVICE#GENERAL*SERVICE#GENERAL
The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. 	SERVICE#GENERAL
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she "had a BBQ to go to" that night - WTF??	SERVICE#GENERAL
I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!	SERVICE#GENERAL
There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. 	SERVICE#GENERAL
I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. 	SERVICE#GENERAL
Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.	SERVICE#GENERAL
Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service. 	SERVICE#GENERAL*RESTAURANT#PRICES

While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.	DRINKS#QUALITY
This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.	SERVICE#GENERAL
His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.	SERVICE#GENERAL

I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.	SERVICE#GENERAL
