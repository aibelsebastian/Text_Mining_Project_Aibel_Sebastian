First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.	AMBIENCE#GENERAL
Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.	AMBIENCE#GENERAL
The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.	AMBIENCE#GENERAL*FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS*DRINKS#PRICES
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.	DRINKS#QUALITY*DRINKS#PRICES
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.	SERVICE#GENERAL
For instance, plates were just dumped on the table, I was handed the wine list upside down, etc.... 	SERVICE#GENERAL
Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service.	SERVICE#GENERAL
To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora.	FOOD#QUALITY*RESTAURANT#GENERAL

Very "normal Indian food", but done really well.	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS*FOOD#QUALITY

My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.

There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about.

I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane.	SERVICE#GENERAL
I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, "can I help you" and "how many are in your party."	SERVICE#GENERAL
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.	SERVICE#GENERAL
We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service.	SERVICE#GENERAL*SERVICE#GENERAL

The design of the space is good.	AMBIENCE#GENERAL
But the service is HORRID!	SERVICE#GENERAL
I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter.	SERVICE#GENERAL*SERVICE#GENERAL
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.	SERVICE#GENERAL
I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!	SERVICE#GENERAL
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).	SERVICE#GENERAL
I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.	SERVICE#GENERAL
She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.	SERVICE#GENERAL
I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.	RESTAURANT#GENERAL*SERVICE#GENERAL
